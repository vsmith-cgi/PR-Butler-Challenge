description: Automate comprehensive pre-commit / PR preparation — translations, code cleanup, tests, documentation, and quality gates.
---

## Overview

The PR Butler automates the complete pre-commit checklist for web projects, ensuring code is ship-ready before PR submission. It orchestrates translation fixes, code cleanup, test generation, documentation updates, and quality validation in a single pass.

### When to Invoke

- User runs "prepare for PR" or "pre-commit check"
- User asks to "fix the scaffold" or "make this PR-ready"
- Before any pull request submission

---

## Instructions

<!-- 
  YOUR TASK: Fill in the detailed step-by-step instructions for each of the 6 steps below.
  Each step should tell the AI agent exactly what to do, what files to touch, 
  and what output to produce. Be specific — vague instructions produce vague results.
-->

### Step 1: Translation Detection & Fix

<!-- Describe how to detect missing French translations and generate them -->

### Step 2: Code Cleanup

<!-- Describe how to format code and fix lint violations -->

### Step 3: Test Automation

<!-- Describe how to run tests, generate missing test cases, achieve >80% coverage -->

### Step 4: Documentation Updates

<!-- Describe how to add docstrings, update README.md, generate CHANGELOG.md and PR_REQUEST.md -->

### Step 5: Quality Gates

<!-- Describe the quality gates to enforce before proceeding -->

### Step 6: PR Preparation

<!-- Describe how to generate the conventional commit message and finalize deliverables -->

---

## Examples

<!-- 
  YOUR TASK: Provide at least 2 example scenarios showing input and expected output.
  Example: "Make the scaffold PR-ready" → what the agent reports at each step.
-->

### Example 1: Full PR Preparation

**Input:** "Make the scaffold PR-ready"

**Expected output:**

```
<!-- Fill in the expected step-by-step output -->
```

### Example 2: Translation-Only Run

**Input:** "Fix the missing French translations"

**Expected output:**

```
<!-- Fill in the expected output -->
```

## Step 7: Report Card (Do Not Modify)

After completing all steps above, generate a **Report Card** summarizing the results. Output the report card in the following exact format:
